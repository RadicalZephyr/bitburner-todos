# Ideas of tasks to try with Tucker

## Fill out the README with better "how to use this repo" instructions

Include fixing the alias for "bootstrapping" the repo by renaming the
bootstrap script that is built by Github Actions.

## Find the most file with the most complex code

Suggest a refactoring to make it more readable and testable.

More of a demo task TBH, but it could have interesting results.

## Meta Task for coming up with interesting tasks

Try to construct a meta-prompt telling it to come up with off-the-wall
ideas for tasks to ask Codex to do.

## Refactoring harvest main function into more modular (and testable?) chunks

It's gotten very long and quite intricate, we could ask Codex to try
and break down the complexity and extract out well-named conceptually
coherent functions to make it cleaner and easier to read.

## Refactoring parameter lists into options objects

I'm pretty confident it can do it, so not super interesting.
