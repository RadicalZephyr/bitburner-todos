# Ideas of tasks to try with Tucker


## Refactoring harvest main function into more modular (and testable?) chunks

It's gotten very long and quite intricate, we could ask Codex to try
and break down the complexity and extract out well-named conceptually
coherent functions to make it cleaner and easier to read.

## Refactoring parameter lists into options objects

I'm pretty confident it can do it, so not super interesting.
